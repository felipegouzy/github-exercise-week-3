## Getting Started
1. Create a project folder
2. Use a code editor of your choice to write the HTML and CSS necessary to create the two page mockups (internal links to home and Portfolio must work, other pages can use # placeholder URL's)
3. Push your code to your GitHub repo, and submit the link

## Tips On Committing Messages
- Commit your code to GitHub early and often
- Write clear, easily understood commit messages
- A good Git commit message will read like a sentence, like so, "If applied, this commit will Update link colors to red by default, and black on hover"
- Update link colors to red by default, and black on hover is the message â€” note how it naturally follows "If applied, this will X"
- Do not include periods at the end of commit messages
- Capitalize the first letter, but leave the rest lower (unless using a proper name)
- Do not write vague messages; avoid jokes and memes; Git commit messages last forever, and will be read by other developers and/or employers
